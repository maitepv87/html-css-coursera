        <h2>Rooted in Nature, Driven by Design</h2>
        <p>
          Lucky Shrub began with a simple idea: create spaces that breathe,
          bloom, and bring joy. Located in the heart of Tucson, Arizona, our
          team blends botanical expertise with design forward thinking to
          transform outdoor areas into custom-built oases.
        </p>
        <p>
          Whether you're cultivating a cozy corner for meditation or reinventing
          your entire landscape, our goal is to make greenery accessible,
          expressive, and meaningful.
